## Hi there! 👋

I’m **Ofelia Popescu**, a **Consulting Associate** at [Outsmart Insight](https://www.outsmartinsight.com/) and a final-year **PhD researcher in Biophysics** at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/ofelia-popescu).

I build **end-to-end data and modelling pipelines** — from raw experimental data (including images and time-series) to statistical models, simulations, and clear visualizations that support decision-making.

---

### 🚀 What I’ve Built

**End-to-end image → insight pipeline**
- Designed and implemented a full pipeline from **raw microscopy images** to **processed visualizations of bacterial growth**
- Built custom **image processing workflows** (segmentation, feature extraction, error handling)
- Extracted quantitative growth metrics and applied **regression and statistical analysis**
- Produced reproducible plots and summaries for downstream interpretation

**Stochastic simulation pipeline (public repository)**
- Developed a **simulation framework** for bacterial growth using **stochastic models**
- Implemented parameterized simulations, batch runs, and result aggregation
- Used simulations to explore variability, uncertainty, and system-level behaviour

**Time-series analysis pipeline (in progress)**
- Built a **Python pipeline** for analysing spectrophotometer-based bacterial growth curves
- Implemented preprocessing, normalization, growth-rate estimation, and regression
- Focused on robust handling of **noisy, real-world time-series data**
  *(Repository to be made public)*

### 🧰 Tools & Skills

- **Python**, MATLAB  
- Image processing & feature extraction  
- Time-series analysis & regression  
- Stochastic modelling & simulations  
- Statistical inference & uncertainty analysis  
- Reproducible workflows (Git)

---

### 📌 Current Focus

- Building **robust, end-to-end analytics pipelines**
- Applying scientific modelling techniques to **industry and business problems**
- Communicating complex results clearly to **non-technical stakeholders**

### 🎯 What I’m Looking For

- **(Applied) Data Scientist**
- **Modelling-focused data roles**
- Quantitative roles, including **finance-adjacent modelling**

I’m especially interested in problems involving **uncertainty, time-series data, and decision-making**, where models are used to inform real-world choices.
