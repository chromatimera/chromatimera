I'm **Ofelia Popescu**. Currently a **Consulting Associate** at [Outsmart Insight](https://www.outsmartinsight.com/) and a final year **PhD Student in Biophtysics** at [University of Edinburgh]([https://www.outsmartinsight.com/](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/ofelia-popescu)). I enjoy turning messy, high-dimensional data into clear insights, models, and decisions.

🔬 Background  
 * 🎓 PhD in Biophysics  
 * 📐 Strong foundation in physics, statistics, and mathematical modeling  
 * 🧬 Research focus: image processing, antibiotics, bacterial resistance  
 * 📊 Extensive experience with experimental + computational data  
 * 🧠 Comfortable moving between theory, simulations, and real data  

🧰 Tech & Tools

Languages  
 * Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn, Jupyter notebooks)  
 * MATLAB (MATLAB live scripts)


Data & Modeling  
 * Statistical modeling & regression  
 * Time-series analysis  
 * Stochastic simulations  
 * Optimization & parameter inference  
 * Image & signal processing  
 * Data Engineering / Workflow
 * Git & GitHub  


📌 Current Focus  
 * 🧪 Translating scientific rigor → industry-ready analytics  
 * 🗂 Building clean, reproducible data pipelines  
 * 🧠 Improving storytelling & visualization for decision-making  

🎯 What I’m Looking For    
I’m interested in roles such as:  
 * **(Applied) Data Scientist**  
 * **Data Analyst / Modelling-focused roles**  
 * **Quantitative or modelling-heavy positions**, including finance-adjacent roles  

I enjoy working on problems that involve:  
- building models under uncertainty  
- working with time-series and noisy data  
- translating complex analyses into clear, usable insights
