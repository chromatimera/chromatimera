## Hi there! 👋

I’m **Ofelia Popescu**, a **Consulting Associate** at [Outsmart Insight](https://www.outsmartinsight.com/) and a final-year **PhD researcher in Biophysics** at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/ofelia-popescu).

I build **end-to-end data and modelling pipelines** — from raw experimental data to statistical models, simulations and visualizations that support decision-making.

### 🚀 What I’ve Built

🖼️ **End-to-end Image → Mechanistic Model pipeline (MATLAB)**
- Designed and implemented a full pipeline from **raw microscopy images** to **processed visualizations of bacterial growth**
- Built custom **image processing workflows** (segmentation, feature extraction, error handling)
- Extracted quantitative growth metrics and applied **regression and statistical analysis**
- Produced reproducible plots and summaries for downstream interpretation

🧪 **Stochastic bacterial growth simulation (Python)**
- Developed a **simulation framework** for bacterial growth using **Gillespie algorithm** and **Poisson** loading of populations
- Used simulations to explore variability, uncertainty, and system-level behaviour

📈 **Time-series bacterial growth analysis pipeline (in progress)**
- Built a **Python pipeline** for analysing spectrophotometer-based bacterial growth curves
- Implemented preprocessing, normalization, growth-rate estimation, and regression
- Focused on robust handling of **noisy, real-world time-series data**
  *(Repository to be made public)*

### 🧰 Tools & Skills

- 🐍 **Python**, 📐 **MATLAB**  
- 🖼️ Image processing & feature extraction  
- 📈 Time-series analysis & regression  
- 🎲 Stochastic modelling & simulations  
- 📊 Statistical inference & uncertainty analysis  
- 🔁 Reproducible workflows (Git)

### 📌 Current Focus

- 🧱 Building **robust, end-to-end analytics pipelines**
- 🧠 Applying scientific modelling techniques to **industry and business problems**
- 🗣️ Communicating complex results clearly to **non-technical stakeholders**

---

### 🎯 What I’m Looking For

- **(Applied) Data Scientist**
- **Modelling-focused data roles**
- Quantitative roles, including **finance-adjacent modelling**

I’m especially interested in problems involving **uncertainty, time-series data, and decision-making**, where models are used to inform real-world choices.
